the last three layers were removed from each network. Three new layers (fully connected layer, soft-max layer and classification layer) were appended to the remaining structure of each network. Higher learning rates were set for the newly added fully connected layers so that the first part of each network remains relatively unchanged during training and the newly added layers get fine-tuned on our dataset. Five-fold cross validation is used to train and test the robustness of each architecture.
